Coffeescript is a language that compiles into javascript, and adds idioms and code structure familiar from object oriented languages like ruby and python.

There are lots of free online resources for learning coffeescript. Here are some!
[coffeescript.org](coffescript.org)'s "try coffeescript" is the easiest place to experiment with coffeescript.
You can type in coffeescript on the left and see the javascript it generates on the right.


Framer.js has a good [Cheatsheet](http://framerjs.com/learn.html#coffeescript)
The Coffescript Cookbook is a good [Tutorial](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/regular_expressions/replacing-substrings)

For everything we do, try typing it in the editor in coffeescript.org, or another place where you can ger immediate feedback. But because what you type won't stick around, and this is a learning experience, keep a record of what you do in a [text editor](https://atom.io/).
When you create files in your editor, remember to use the `.coffee` extension, as in the file `learning_coffeescript.coffee` so you get syntax highlighting and make sure those files get compiled into javascript!
