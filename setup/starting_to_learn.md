"Learning is the best." -- @rachelmyers

# On Your Mark, Get Set, Go

This is a quick guide to get you and your amazing computering machine ready
to get your learn on.

## Things You Will Need

* A computer and power mechanism of some sort (cable, supply, small hamster on a wheel)
* Account on GitHub : http://www.github.com
* Software
  * Atom - https://atom.io/
    * CoffeeScript Package
  * Github for Mac/Windows : https://mac.github.com / https://windows.github.com

### Computer

Most of the instructors work with macs, however all the tools we
will be using have a Microsoft Windows equivalent so you should be able to use either.

If you have a problem getting any of this software installed in this guide,
please reach out in The Learning Room on chat before the training session that way we can all hit the ground running.


### Account on GitHub

If you don't already have an account on GitHub, you can go to
https://github.com/ and sign up.

### Software

While there are many different ways to use Git and also tons of text editors,
we are going to walk the path of lease resistance and use the GitHub git client and the Atom text editor. If you are comfortable using something else, feel free, but you may want install these as well incase we end up
using a feature or functionality that your chosen clients don't support.

#### Atom

You can download Atom from https://atom.io/.

Even if you have Atom from before (from Boxen or an old install), you may want to download the latest/check to make sure you have the latest version as Atom has changed a lot in the last year or so.

At the time of writing this, 0.124.0 is the latest version.

##### CoffeeScript for Atom

In order to change CoffeeScript to JavaScript we will need a CoffeeScript compiler. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, we will explain why in the training, but to get ready we ask that you install the `coffeescript-build` Atom package (https://atom.io/packages/coffeescript-build).

To install an Atom package,

1. Open Atom and from the Atom menu select `Preferences`
2. Click on `Packages` from the left hand column.
3. On the right, under `Install Packages` in the text field type in `coffeescript-build` and hit enter
4. Once Atom searches its packages it should return for you a package with the title `Coffeescript Build`. Click on the button `Install`

#### GitHub for Your OS

In order to connect to GitHub and upload the code we are going to write, we will be using GitHub for Your OS:

* GitHub for Mac: https://mac.github.com/
* GitHub for Windows: https://windows.github.com/

Download and install the software for your OS and start the app. You will be prompted for your login and password and it will assist you in setting up an SSH key if you need to.
